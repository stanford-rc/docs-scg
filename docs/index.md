# SCG Informatics Cluster

The SCG Informatics Cluster resources are available for use by labs
engaged in genetics and bioinformatics research. The SCG Cluster is
designed and managed to support large memory, serial and single node
threaded applications as well as applications and workflows that require
many small files. Other clusters on campus are available for more
general-purpose or HPC oriented user communities, see the [Stanford Research
Computing Center](https://srcc.stanford.edu/services-systems-overview) for more
details.
