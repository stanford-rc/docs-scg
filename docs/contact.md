## SCG Announce Mailing List

The [SCG Announce mailing
list](https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/suoptions/scg-announce/) is a low
traffic list intended for major outage notice, office hour session and other SCG related
announcements that are of interest to the entire SCG community. You can
subscribe [here](https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/suoptions/scg-announce/).

Note that the `#announce` channel in the [SCG Slack
Workspace](https://susciclu.slack.com) will have
these announcements plus additional details that impact subsets of SCG users and
is the more complete and up-to-date location to get SCG announcements and updates.

## SCG Action Mailing List

Questions, probelms and requests can be sent to the [SCG Action Mailing
List](mailto:scg-action@lists.stanford.edu). This list is seen by the SCG
development teams and the sysadmins and messages sent here will automatically
create a ticket with the [Stanford Research Computing
Center](https://srcc.stanford.edu/).

## Stanford Research Computing Center

If all else fails, email directly to [Stanford Research Computing
Center](https://srcc.stanford.edu/) support at
[research-computing-support@stanford.edu](mailto:research-computing-support@stanford.edu).
