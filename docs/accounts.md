# Requirements

Using the SCG resources requires a SUNetID which is associated with one or more
PI (faculty) lab groups. Collaborators not affiliated with Stanford University
may request a sponsored SUNetID by applying on the [Stanford University
Accounts website](https://sunetid.stanford.edu/) and then asking an SCG
affiliated PI or project owner to sponsor the request. Basic sponsored SUNet
accounts (without email or AFS storage) are free.

# PI/Lab Affiliation

If your lab has no current affiliation with SCG, please send an email to the
[SCG Action Team](mailto:scg-action@lists.stanford.edu) to receive
information on how to become a member of the SCG cluster. If not the PI
of your lab group, please include the PI in the CC of the email.

# Service Tiers and Rates

There are two service tiers for PI/Lab affiliation with SCG:

| Tier | Storage Quota | Compute Partition Access    |
|------|---------------|-----------------------------|
| Free |        128 GB |        interactive, nih_s10 |
| Full |  7 TB or more | batch, interactive, nih_s10 |

There is no charge for the Free Tier access to SCG. For Full Tier access, rates are:

* $56.00/month
* $8.00/TB/month for storage over initial 7 TB quota
* $0.05/core-hour for batch partition usage

# User Accounts

Once a SUNetID is acquired, an SCG cluster account can be requested by sending
an email to the [SCG Action Team](mailto:scg-action@lists.stanford.edu) from the
PI for the lab group or from the person requesting the account with the PI cc'd
on the email. 

# Projects

For projects that span multiple PIs, have dedicated project funding, or other
special requirements which don't fit well within a PI associated lab account, a
special project can be created. Projects are set up on a case by case basis
around the specific needs and requirements for each one. Mail the [SCG Action
Team](mailto:scg-action@lists.stanford.edu) to request setting up a project.
