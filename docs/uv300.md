# SGI UV300 SuperComputer

Stanford provides access to an on-site supercomputer for biomedical researchers
who need to run analyses requiring large, dedicated computing resources to be
applied to their solutions simultaneously, such as many CPUs, large memory,
fast local storage, and/or high-powered GPUs.  This supercomputer, an SGI (now
part of Hewlett Packard Enterprise) UV300 machine, was acquired via a NIH S10
Shared Instrumentation Grant.  It has:

* 360 cores
* 10 terabytes of random-access memory (RAM)
* 20 terabytes of flash memory
* 4 NVidia Pascal GPUs (P100s, especially suited to deep learning)
* 150+ terabytes of local scratch storage. 

The UV300 is available on the SCG cluster in the `nih_s10` partition. For more information about how to use it see:

* [Working with Slurm](tutorials/job_scripts.md)
* [Using GPUs](tutorials/gpus.md)

This supercomputer is made available to the Stanford community via the Genetics
Bioinformatics Service Center (GBSC).  For more background information about
the UV-300 and the GBSC, see the [GBSC
website](http://gbsc.stanford.edu/uv300.html).
